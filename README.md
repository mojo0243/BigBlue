This script requires you to already have metasploit installed as all of the exploits listeners will start a multi handler.
This is version 1.0 and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on ways you think it could be made better.
I have not tested this against all versions of windows listed but those versions are taken from the original exploit code used.
This script does not do anything that metasploit doesn't do except it automatically sends the exploit for you once you provide
the IP you wish to attack and it is written in python.
My main reason for writting this isn't to replace any existing tools but to work on learning python.

The script will present you with a menu followed by either another menu or questions about your choice.
Finally once all questions have been answered the script will attempt to send the chosen exploit against the target.

ENJOY!
